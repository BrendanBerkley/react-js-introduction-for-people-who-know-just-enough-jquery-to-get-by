Like the cow above, I also heard React.js was good and spent some time playing with it. Now that I'm pretty comfortable with React, I decided to write yet another tutorial on this subject.

## Target Audience: People Who Know Just Enough jQuery to Get by

Before I begin, I'd like to clarify who the target audience is.

Zed Shaw, the author of "[Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/)" series, recently wrote an excellent blog post called [Early v.s. Beginning Coders](http://zedshaw.com/2015/06/16/early-vs-beginning-coders/). In his post, Zed criticizes programming educators who claim that their materials are for "beginners", but in reality are incomprehensible for most "total" beginners.

I don't want to make a similar mistake here. Of people who have never tried out React, some are comfortable with frontend JS frameworks like [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), or [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). Some know JavaScript pretty well. Some know just enough jQuery to get by. A tutorial that's effective for one group may not be optimal for the other groups.

In this tutorial, I'm targeting the third group I mentioned: **people who know just enough jQuery to get by**. Examples of people who might fit in this category would be:

- Designers who can do basic coding in HTML/CSS/jQuery.
- Wordpress developers who know how to use jQuery plugins.
- Beginning developers who have completed basic HTML/CSS/JS tutorials online.
- Backend developers who rely on Bootstrap and basic jQuery for their frontend needs.
- Anyone who does more copy-pasting than architecting when it comes to JavaScript.

If you're comfortable with JavaScript or any of the frontend frameworks, this tutorial is probably not for you, and you'll be very frustrated with my writing style. Otherwise, let's get started!

## Overview: We're Going to Build a "Tweet Box"

Many React.js tutorials begin by explaining how React works or why React is awesome. My tutorial will not.

Instead, we'll get right to building a simple UI, alternating between jQuery implementations and React.js implementations, explaining the differences along the way. The UI will resemble the Tweet box that you find on [Twitter](http://twitter.com):

## Step 1: Introduction to JSBin

We'll be using [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/), an online HTML/CSS/JS editor which supports both jQuery and React.js code. You might be familiar with similar services like [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) - they're all pretty similar, so I just decided to go with JSBin.

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/fisawa/2/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Try modifying the HTML on the left - i.e. change the button's text. You'll see the change on the right.

You can click "Save" on the menu to save changes on your JSBin account (after creating one). Once you're on the JSBin site, you can add a library to import things like Bootstrap.

I then added (1) bootstrap (CSS only; removed JS), and (2) `btn btn-primary` classes on `<button>`, and the output is a little prettier:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/fisawa/5/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Now that you've seen some JSBins, llet's build out a tweet box. I've used some Bootstrap classes like `well`, `clearfix`, etc., but those are just for the looks and irrelevant for the tutorial.
